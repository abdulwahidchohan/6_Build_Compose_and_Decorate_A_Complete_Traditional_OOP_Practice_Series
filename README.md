# 🧱 Build, Compose & Decorate: A Complete Traditional OOP Practice Series

Welcome to **Abdul Wahid Chohan's** comprehensive practice series on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python. This repository contains 21 thoughtfully designed assignments that walk you through the most fundamental to the more advanced concepts in OOP.

## 📌 Purpose

This series aims to solidify traditional OOP concepts by writing clean, structured, and practical Python code examples. This series is perfect for:

* Students learning Python OOP

* Beginners practicing class design

* Anyone preparing for coding interviews or exams

* Those wanting to brush up on OOP principles with real-world patterns

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Each assignment targets a specific OOP concept:

 1. `self` keyword and instance attributes

 2. `cls` and class-level tracking

 3. Public variables and methods

 4. Class variables and class methods

 5. Static methods

 6. Constructors and destructors

 7. Access modifiers: Public, Protected, Private

 8. Inheritance with `super()`

 9. Abstract classes using `abc`

10. Instance methods

11. Class methods

12. Static methods (again, for reinforcement)

13. **Composition** (has-a relationship)

14. **Aggregation** (loose has-a relationship)

15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) & Diamond Inheritance

16. Function decorators

17. Class decorators

18. Property decorators (`@property`, setter, deleter)

19. `__call__()` and `callable()`

20. Custom exceptions

21. Custom iterators using `__iter__()` and `__next__()`

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each concept is demonstrated in an individual `.py` file, typically titled and numbered for easy reference:
